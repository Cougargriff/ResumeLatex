\opening{To whom it may concern,}

I am writing this letter to express interest in a \companyName .\\ 

I am a driven Software Engineer who recently graduated from \university . Working on complex projects during my time at Cal Poly allowed me to develop a diverse skill set and pushed me to keep learning. My passion for software has led to me expanding my skill set with a variety of side projects from mobile apps in Android to newer web frameworks like React. Recently, I've been developing a Android app that acts as a tool for users to connect with other players of a particular video game. The app uses a cloud data solution in order to store appropriate user information.\\ 

(Transition?)

Being an Instructional Assistant at Cal poly enhanced my ability to communicate effectively and problem solve with individuals working on their own projects. Often times students had trouble structuring their app to meet their expectations. When students struggled I provided guidance allowing them to create their own successful app. I believe my experience working with students can be applied to streamline interactions between team members resulting in increased productivity. 

If you have any questions about my past employment or projects, you can reach me anytime at \phoneNum or by email at \email. I look forward to discussing the position further with you in more detail. If hired, I feel confident that I can hit the ground running with any team I'm paired up with. \\

Thank you for this opportunity.
